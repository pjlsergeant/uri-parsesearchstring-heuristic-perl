=head1 PARSING OVERVIEW

=head2 Two types of search engine

We're going to start with the concept of I<Search Engine Families> (SEF). Google
is an I<international> SEF, where SAPO is a local SEF (Portuguese, as it
happens). SEF's have different sections which return different results - perhaps
an image search and a blog search. International SEF's also show differing
regional results - Google UK returns different results from Google Canada.

In contrast, we also have I<Stand-Alone Search Engines> (SASE). There used to be
B<lots> of these, but consolidation within the industry has meant that many are
now just a front for a SEF's underlying engine.

=head2 What we return

As you'll see a little further down, we only provide one interesting method,
which is C<parse>. C<parse> returns a hashref if it was able to match search
terms, otherwise it returns C<undef>.

From a successful match, you will always get at least C<search_terms>,
C<engine_name>, and C<engine_expanded_name> returned. If you were parsing a URL
from a SASE, then C<engine_expanded_name> will just be a copy of C<engine_name>.

If you were parsing a URL from a SEF, you might also get back a C<engine_type>,
which is the type of search performed. For a normal search, this won't be set,
but if we've detected an image or blog search, we'll set this. You can see a
list of possibilities in the documentation below.

If you were parsing a URL from an international SEF, then we might have set
C<engine_locality>. The C<engine_locality> field is a country-code, from which
you can derive a name. This won't ever be set from a SASE.

C<engine_locality>
which is the geographical subsite that was searched. If the URL came from an
image or blog search

Pull out the hostname
If it's a family:
	Save the locality
	Look for specifics
		In the host

Is it a search?
If so:
	Mark out the type if we can
	Pull out the search terms as well we can
	Pull out any geographics
	Pull out any 'start' info we happen to have

Fix encoding as relevant, and suck in any overrides
